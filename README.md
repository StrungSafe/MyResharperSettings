# My Resharper Settings

These are my Resharper settings and live templates that I like to use.

## Using Resharper Settings

To use these settings, copy the 'StrungSafe.DotSettings' file and paste into the the same directory as the 'sln' file.
Next, rename to '{SolutionName}.sln.DotSettings' where {SolutionName} is the name of the solution.
